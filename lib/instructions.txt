INSTRUCTIONS:

This is a one person game. You will be playing against me,
the computer.

Once you start the game, I will place a destroyer(length 2)
and a cruiser(length 3).

After I place my ships, you will be prompted to place your
own destroyer and cruiser. The grid will look like this:

                      . 1 2 3 4
                      A . . . .
                      B . . . .
                      C . . . .
                      D . . . .

If you choose coordiantes that do not work for a two lengthed,
or three lengthed ship, I will let you know. The ships can be
placed horizontally or vertically, never diagonally.

Once all of our ships are placed, I will let you go first to
take a shot at my board. We will rotate one by one hitting at
each other's boards.

The game is over when someone guesses all coordinates of
their opponents ships, thus sinking their ships.


GOOD LUCK! AND HAVE FUN!
